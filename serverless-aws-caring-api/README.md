## API Endpoints


### POST-- {baseURL}/expression : 

- When a user gets registered or gets authorization it will create a new user in the db with userId, account_id, first_name, last_name, email, start_time, end_time, and expression_array, also passing these as request body. Initially, it will create the Day 1 expression array. 
- Expression_array: It will be an array of arrays with a Day object and on that day it will contain an emotion array generated every second.
- See the use in Face-Detection-App -> [here](https://github.com/ShenpaiSharma/Caring-App/blob/535c9c4767bafeec4c0bc770c89e349f67ae59d3/Face-Detection/public/script.js#L69)

Response Status code: 
- 201: User successfully created.
- 403: If a user with the same email id and account_id already exists. {message: 'User already exists'}.
- 500: Internal Server error.

### PUT-- {baseURL}/update/expression :

- For every successful registration or signin it will push the new day emotion array data of every second in the expression_array. For ex: When a user registers it will create a Day 1 emotion array and push it into the expression array and with signin it will push the new day emotion array data into the existing expression array.
- It will take user_id, first_name, email, expression_array as a request body, and use the email to find the user to update.
- See the use in Face-Detection-App: [here](https://github.com/ShenpaiSharma/Caring-App/blob/535c9c4767bafeec4c0bc770c89e349f67ae59d3/Face-Detection/public/script.js#L146)

## Usage

### Deployment

This example is made to work with the Serverless Framework dashboard, which includes advanced features such as CI/CD, monitoring, metrics, etc.

In order to deploy with dashboard, you need to first login with:

```
serverless login
```

install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

and then perform deployment with:

```
serverless deploy
```

### Local development

It is also possible to emulate API Gateway and Lambda locally by using `serverless-offline` plugin. In order to do that, execute the following command:

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-offline
```

It will add the `serverless-offline` plugin to `devDependencies` in `package.json` file as well as will add it to `plugins` in `serverless.yml`.

After installation, you can start local emulation with:

```
serverless offline
```

To learn more about the capabilities of `serverless-offline`, please refer to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline).
