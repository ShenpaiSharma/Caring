- Line-Chart: It shows the emotion of every second of the last day, i.e, the last interaction with the Face detection App. 
We can filter to create an average with respect to filter seconds. So, data rendering on the dashboard will be entirely dependent on the user. For example, in an hour-long zoom meeting, if the user will filter according to 5 min, it will be much less load on the dashboard as compared to if the user wishes to see his every second emotion data, and it will also help us from the avoiding of such clutter form of the chart by showing every second detail.
